				<h1>Workshop on Space-Air-Ground-Sea Integrated Sensing, Computing, and Communications For 6G IoT</h1>
				<br>
				<h2>In conjunction with the 26th IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference 2025 (WCNC 2025)</h2>
				<h2>TBD, 2025</h2>

					<h2>THE WORKSHOP SCOPE</h2>
						<p>In the precipice of the sixth generation (6G) of wireless communications, the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies across space, air, ground, and sea domains represents a transformative leap towards realising a truly interconnected global society. This integration promises to drive a paradigm shift in global connectivity, data acquisition, and computational capabilities, facilitating an unprecedented level of intelligent automation and service delivery across various sectors. The future directions of Space-Air-Ground-Sea (SAGS) integrated sensing, communications, and computing networks for 6G IoT aims to propose a unified framework where data collected through satellite constellations, aerial platforms, terrestrial networks, and maritime nodes are seamlessly transmitted, aggregated, processed, and utilised.  Currently, due to the limited traditional network capacity, the computation capacity limitation of the IoT user, and the long latency of the backhaul links, the traditional wireless communications systems' functionalities of mobile sensing, communications, and computing have been designed in isolation. Therefore, reducing the delay and energy consumption of the entire wireless communications system including all the above functionalities is still difficult. The 6G era is poised to revolutionise the existing wireless communications networks through the synergistic integration of mobile sensing, communications and computing of the SAGS multiple domains. Different from the existing fifth-generation (5G) networks' capacity increase research, 6G is poised to bring novel distributed architectures according to the SAGS framework to achieve ultra-low latency, ultra-high reliability, and ultra-high-capacity requirements of different IoT applications and services.</p> 
						<p>The fundamental objective of the workshop is to deconstruct the intricate complexities associated with the design and implementation of 6G SAGS integrated sensing, communications, and computing IoT networks that facilitate seamless interconnection across a variety of environments. These range from the stringent ultra-low latency demands for space missions to the resilient communication protocols required for underwater exploration. Additionally, integrating computational functionalities within 6G IoT networks heralds a transformative era in data processing, edge computing, and distributed artificial intelligence (AI). By capitalising on technological breakthroughs such as AI and edge computing, we stand to unlock unprecedented opportunities for real-time decision-making, blockchain security preservation, digital twin network monitoring, and resource optimisation within a network of interconnected domains. Sensing constitutes the linchpin of situational awareness within integrated networks, facilitating context-aware communication and precise navigational capabilities. The deployment of sophisticated sensing technologies, including IoT devices and remote sensing platforms, can enhance our comprehension of the ambient environment and refine network performance in dynamically evolving and demanding scenarios. Benefiting from the aforementioned advantages, it can also be implemented from a co-design perspective, wherein the computing, communications and sensing functionalities are simultaneously performed to optimise the performance of different 6G SAGS integrated sensing, computing, and communications scenarios.</p> 
				                <p> We are seeking original, completed, and unpublished works that are not under review elsewhere, aiming to assemble a collection of high-quality, crosscutting research papers on a variety of topics, which include, but are not limited to:</p>
