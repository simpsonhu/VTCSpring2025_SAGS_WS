					<h2>THE WORKSHOP SCOPE</h2>
						<p> With the explosive growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) services and applications, such as autonomous driving, digital twins, blockchain, VR/AR, industry 4.0, etc. Currently, due to the limited traditional network capacity, the computation capacity limitation of the end user, and the long latency of the backhaul links, the traditional wireless communications systems' functionalities of mobile sensing, communications, and computation have been designed in isolation. Therefore, reducing the delay and energy consumption of the entire wireless communications system including all the above functionalities is still difficult. Meanwhile, there has been an exponential multiplication of communication systems and paradigms, with their scope enlarging beyond the traditional terrestrial domain to incorporate atmospheric, extraterrestrial, and subaqueous realms. The 6G era is poised to revolutionise the existing wireless communications networks through the synergistic integration of mobile sensing, communications and computation of the space-air-ground-sea (SAGS) multiple domains. Different from the existing 5G networks' capacity increase research, 6G is poised to bring novel distributed architectures according to the SAGS framework to achieve ultra-low latency, ultra-high reliability, and ultra-high-capacity requirements of different IoT applications and services. Participants will gain insight into the foundational principles, current trends, and future directions of 6G-empowered IoT, fostering a comprehensive understanding of their interplay and implications for various industries.</p> 
				                <p> We are seeking original, completed, and unpublished works that are not under review elsewhere, aiming to assemble a collection of high-quality, crosscutting research papers on a variety of topics, which include, but are not limited to:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Mobile edge computing in space-air-ground-sea integrated networks for 6G IoT</li>
							<li>AI-empowered space-air-ground-sea integrated deep connectivity for 6G IoT </li>
							<li>Cloud/Edge Computing offloading for space-air-ground-sea integrated for 6G IoT</li>
